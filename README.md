License Plate Detection System
Overview
This project implements a license plate detection system using Flask for web-based interaction and a machine learning model for plate recognition. Users can upload images to the Flask server, which then performs license plate detection and provides predictions.

Project Structure
app.py: A Flask server application allowing users to upload images for license plate detection and receive predictions.
license_plate_detection.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the model training code and processes.
parse_annotations.py: Script for preprocessing annotation data.
split_dataset.py: Script for splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.
Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized as follows:

data/
positive/
images/: Contains images with license plates.
annotations/: Contains annotation files for the positive images.
negative/
images/: Contains images without license plates.

Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the Dataset:

Organize your dataset according to the structure outlined above.
Ensure that parse_annotations.py and split_dataset.py are executed to prepare the data for training.
Usage
Train the Model:

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook license_plate_detection.ipynb to train the model using the dataset.
Start the Flask Server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The server will start on http://localhost:5000.
Upload and Predict:

Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
Upload an image for license plate detection and view the prediction results.
Future Improvements
Integrate license plate recognition and verification against the Indian RTO website to check for existing challans.
